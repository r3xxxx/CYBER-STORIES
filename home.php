        <h1> A Cyber Story, on our journey</h1>

        <p>Cyber stories was an idea I (Rex Godbout), came up with to give "my friend" jake regele an idea for his project. He rejected the idea and shortly after I took on my idea and collaborated with Lowell Deschenes to create the next peoples choice prize winning website of the 20-17 UVM CS Fair.
            On this journey we have overcame many barriers. We have spend nights on end to create this work of art </br> 
        <h2> What even is this thing?    </h2>
            <p> We wanted to create a platform where children in need can easily access fun childrens' books to alleviate some of the pain they are facing in there curret lives. This website can be installed in almost setting, a hospital, a school, anywhere!</p>
            <h2>About the Author </h2>
 <p> About the author: My name is Lowell Deschenes.
 I am the creator of the stories exhibited on this site. 
 The creative process was not very deep on creating these stories. I
 first started by thinking of the broad topics of each story. 
 These topics were that one story would be about a horse, another story would be about chicken, 
 another story would be about cow, another story would be about a goat, and the final story would be about a whale that lives in Lake Champlain. From there I just thought of a title for each of the stories and came up with the story as I wrote it. I did not ever make any plan on what I would write about I just let my train of thought take me to wherever it wanted. The stories are not really meant to have any moral value even though some of them do. They really are just meant for pure silly enjoyment. Some of the stories are a little goofy. Some of the stories are a little sad. All of the stories have happy endings. I chose to end all the stories happy because if you arenâ€™t trying your best to make things happy what are you doing with your life. I hope everyone who reads my stories has a good laugh and feels a little bit happier compared to before they came onto the site.
